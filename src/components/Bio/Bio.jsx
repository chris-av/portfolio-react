      <p>
        My name is Christian Valenzuela and I am a web developer based in the Los Angeles area.
        I started out with programming with R, where I did advanced statistics and computations. 
        I studied Economics and Political Science at UCLA, meaning that I had to be able to read research and statistical models.
